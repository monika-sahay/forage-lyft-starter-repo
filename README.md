# Lyft Back-End Engineering Virtual Experience Program
This project is a part of the Back-End Engineering virtual internship program offered by Forage with Lyft.


# The virtual Internship is divided into four main tasks
1. Software Architecture to come up with a clean design for a messy component using UML methods.
2. Refactoring a messy system in python using design principles.
3. Writing unit tests for a newly refactored system.
4. Test-Driven Development for adding new functionality
