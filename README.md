# Lyft Back-End Engineering Virtual Experience Program
This project is a part of the Back-End Engineering virtual internship program offered by Forage with Lyft.
## About the Virtual Internship Program
The Back-End Engineering virtual internship program is designed to provide hands-on experience and practical skills in various aspects of software development. The program consists of four main tasks, each focusing on a specific area of expertise.

### 1. Software Architecture
In this task, the goal was to design a clean and efficient architecture for a previously messy component. Using UML (Unified Modeling Language) methods, I analyzed the existing system and proposed a well-structured architecture that improves maintainability and scalability.

### 2. Refactoring
The second task involved refactoring a messy system written in Python. By applying design principles and best practices, I restructured the codebase to enhance readability, modularity, and code quality. The refactoring process aimed to improve performance and simplify future enhancements.

### 3. Unit Testing
To ensure the reliability and correctness of the refactored system, I developed comprehensive unit tests. By covering critical functionality and edge cases, these tests verify the behavior of individual components and help identify and fix any regressions or bugs introduced during refactoring.

### 4. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
The final task revolved around implementing new functionality using the Test-Driven Development approach. Following TDD principles, I first wrote tests for the desired features and then iteratively implemented the code to make the tests pass. This methodology ensures that the new functionality is well-tested and aligns with the project requirements.

Feel free to explore the repository, review the code, and access any relevant documentation. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your interest in my project!
